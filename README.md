# Simple Counter

Simple overlay game counter for tracking runs in games.

A lightweight, borderless, semi-transparent overlay built with Python and Tkinter. It sits above your game or application so you can track runs, attempts, or custom counters without taking focus away from the game.

## Features

- Always-on-top overlay window
- Borderless, semi-transparent styling
- Click-and-drag movement
- Left-click to increment
- Right-click to decrement
- Reset button to clear the count
- Designed for gaming sessions and speedruns

## Screenshots

Add a screenshot here later to show the overlay in use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Tkinter (included with most standard Python installs)
